# C++ Primer Book Exercices

As I'm now reviewing and learning new things about C++ using the book ["C++ Primer"](https://www.amazon.es/C-Primer-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1595526556&sr=8-2), I've decided to upload the recommended exercices of each section of the book here. 
So this is a collection of the C++ Primer book exercices coded by myself!

I've had to recode some of the downloadable code from the book in order to properly work on a single project, instead of having a different project for each exercice.
Thank you for taking a look!
